# HS1549-HS1700-S2-protoclusters
This code was used for galaxy protocluster analysis for Lacaille, K. et al., 2019, MNRAS: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06882.pdf

You may find detailed a description for each script with the code.

In general, these scripts:
- identifies galaxy positions;
- statistically estimates whether or not it has a counterpart in a different waveband, and if so, provides its guess with a useful certanty;
- measures how dense the fields are with galaxies and calculates how dense the cores are compared to the entire field;
- finds out if galaxies are hiding beneath the noise limits of the maps;
- calculates the star formation rate & star formation rate density for each protocluster and compares the trends to local galaxy samples.

The code is specified for my data set, but may easily be changed for any set of galaxy or stellar data!
